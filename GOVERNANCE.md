# Governance

This document describes the governance model for the Kusari CLI project.

## Overview

Kusari CLI is maintained by [Kusari](https://kusari.dev) and follows an open governance model where decisions are made transparently with community input.

## Roles

### Maintainers

Maintainers have full commit access and are responsible for:

- Reviewing and merging contributions
- Release management
- Setting project direction
- Ensuring security and quality standards

Current maintainers are listed in [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md).

### Contributors

Anyone who contributes code, documentation, bug reports, or other improvements to the project. Contributors are encouraged to:

- Follow the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Participate in discussions via GitHub Issues
- Help review pull requests

## Decision Making

### Day-to-Day Decisions

Routine decisions (bug fixes, minor features, documentation updates) are made by individual maintainers through the pull request review process.

### Significant Changes

Significant changes (new features, breaking changes, architectural decisions) require:

1. A GitHub Issue describing the proposed change
2. Discussion period for community feedback
3. Approval from at least one maintainer
4. Pull request review and approval

### Conflict Resolution

In cases of disagreement:

1. Maintainers discuss to reach consensus
2. If consensus cannot be reached, a majority vote among maintainers decides
3. In rare cases, Kusari (the sponsoring organization) may make final decisions

## Code of Conduct

All participants are expected to follow professional conduct standards. Be respectful, inclusive, and constructive in all interactions.
